In this context, “objects” refer to physical things including units, equipment, stores, personnel, facilities, geographic features, and also to non-physical concepts such as coordination points, lines, and areas. Such objects may already exist and be known; they may also be newly identified or expected in the future.   \nb. Individual objects must be distinguished from the classes of objects to which they belong. Many objects are of interest primarily in terms of their class or category rather than as an individual object; for example, tanks, armoured brigades, or infantrymen.   \nc. Objects and their types need to be described with a number of characteristics that are sufficient for supporting command and control tasks. For example, it must be possible to describe the size of a unit, the name of a commanding officer, or the military load classification of a bridge. Such information tends to be dynamic in nature; as new information becomes available other information becomes outdated or nullified.   \nd. An explicit subset of the requirement in paragraph $c$ is the need for information elements associated with objects to permit suitable display of the operational situation.   \ne. Selected information about certain characteristics of objects needs to be retained for a period of time. For example, it must be possible to keep a historical log of the location of a unit for purposes of tracking and to specify predicted future locations of a unit for purposes of planning. Such a time record is also needed for other dynamic characteristics of objects, such as their operational or personnel status and their holdings in terms of other objects (e.g., the number of troops and/or equipment in a particular unit).

Thus, OBJECTTYPEs and OBJECT-ITEMs are related to ACTION in three distinct ways: as resources objectives, and subjects of effects, as illustrated in Figure 20.
